This web app is built with create-react-app npm package. It features a google maps javascript API ran with google maps react package. This project is built with React-Redux structure to maintain clean control of state.

##Quick Start

After pulling this repo, run the app by terminal command "npm start". the local app should be hosted on localhost:3000

##Features

Users simply enter a keyword on the search bar and the map with populate with the closest 20 results to them. Users can get directions via google maps to their selected location using google maps URL

##Future Implementations

Allow for advanced search so users can specify a location.

Input directions into the web app. (The free api is pretty limiting on calls, hence we link to actual google maps)

Add images of places.

Have the list as a floating modal over map instead of a div
